# ImportProducts
Node Script to import product details
## Instructions
To run the code run command npm i 
then to run the script node importProducts.js
to run the api type command node productsApi.js

endroute filters the products depending on the Size or Colour

app.get('/products',(req,res)=>{})
## Notes
I have only used Postgres before therefore I have saved the data in the JSON File.
I have previously written test at a synch level therefore haven't added it yet as I would need more 
practice with this.

## Improvements

This can be improved with MongoDB and Jest functionality.
## What's Next
Next with will be to add variety of data with different end points and Jest and MongoDB functionality.
